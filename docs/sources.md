### Savings vs. Stocks (10-Year Comparison)
*   **Data Point:** Average US Savings Rate (~0.4%).
*   **Source:** Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) National Rates.
*   **Time Period:** 2014 – 2024.
*   **Details:** National average rates on savings accounts hovered near 0.06% for much of the decade.
    *   *Nuance:* **High-Yield Savings Accounts (HYSAs)** offered higher rates (peaking ~2% in 2018 and ~5% in 2023), averaging closer to **1.5% - 2.0%** over the decade. Even at this "optimistic" rate, \$10k would only grow to ~$12,200, still significantly trailing the stock market.

*   **Data Point:** S&P 500 Annualized Return (~12.0%).
*   **Source:** Standard & Poor's / Ameriprise / OfficialData.
*   **Time Period:** 2014 – 2024.
*   **Details:** The 10-year annualized **Total Return** (assuming dividends are reinvested) is approximately **12.8% - 15.1%** depending on the specific end month in 2024.
    *   *Price Return Only:* Without dividends, the return is ~10-12%.
    *   *Comparison Fairness:* Since savings accounts compound interest (reinvest), it is fair to compare them against S&P 500 Total Return (reinvested). We use a conservative **~12.0%** figure to avoid overstating the case.
