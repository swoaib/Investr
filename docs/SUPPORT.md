## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. Where does the stock data come from?
We use **Financial Modeling Prep (FMP)** to provide real-time and historical stock market data. While we strive for accuracy, please note that there may be slight delays depending on the market and data provider.

### 2. Do I need to create an account?
No! Investr uses **Anonymous Authentication**. You can start using the app immediately without providing an email or phone number. Your watchlist and preferences are tied to your unique anonymous identifier.

### 3. Why am I not receiving Stock Alerts?
To receive price alerts, you must enable **Notifications** for Investr on your device.
*   **iOS:** Go to Settings > Investr > Notifications > Allow Notifications.
*   **Android:** Go to Settings > Apps > Investr > Notifications > Allow.

### 4. How do I delete my data?
Since we use anonymous authentication, data is linked to your current installation. If you uninstall the app or clear its data, your local watchlist and settings may be reset. For a complete data wipe request, please contact us via email with your User ID (found in Settings, if applicable/implemented).

### 5. Can I recommend a new feature?
Absolutely! We love hearing from our users. You can submit feedback directly within the app (Settings > Send Feedback) or email us at the address above.
